The vast availability of genomic data over the last decade has created a new bottleneck for plant breeding programs. Rapidly collecting, analyzing, and utilizing phenotypic and phenomic data within a single breeding season is paramount to crop improvement. The Rife Lab focuses on developing efficient tools, technologies, and methods to optimize  plant breeding and genetics research. We work with both national and international breeding programs to train and equip plant scientists with the tools they need to develop the improved crops necessary to feed the growing global population.
