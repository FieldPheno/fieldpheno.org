# Practical phenomics for plant scientists

The Rife Lab is a team of researchers at [Clemson University](https://www.clemson.edu/) focused on developing the next generation of tools to effectively collect and manage phenotypic and phenomic data for plant breeding and genetics research. We work with scientists to design novel solutions that allow breeders to efficiently develop the improved crops necessary to feed a growing global population.
