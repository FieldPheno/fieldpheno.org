### Programmers

Our programmers contribute most of the code that goes into our production-ready servers, apps, and analytical pipelines.
They are expected to maintain high standards of documentation, clarity, efficiency, and maintainability in their own code, and also help the other members of the lab achieve the same in their code.

For the machine learning aspects of our work, we currently use a technology stack consisting of Python, numpy/scipy/scikit-learn/theano, and R with assorted packages.
For web development, we currently use a technology stack consisting of Postgres, Python, Django, JavaScript, and React.
Our data processing framework and webservers run on cloud instances, so experience with optimizing workloads for this type of environment is a plus.

### Postdoctoral Researchers

The Greene Lab welcomes applications for computational postdoctoral positions at the University of Pennsylvania Perelman School of Medicine.
The overarching theme of our work is to transform how we understand complex biological systems by integrating big data from diverse sources and developing computational methods that effectively model real-world processes.
We then put these methods into the hands of every biologist, through the development of usable open source tools, and the dissemination of successful applications.

#### Objectives

Postdocs in our lab contribute to the development of new analytical methods and/or the application of these methods to new datasets.
Postdocs will have the opportunity to work with large collections of genomic data, both publicly available and from collaborative projects, and to extract testable biological hypotheses from these large collections.
Research projects center around new computational methods to integrate genomic data as well as to incorporate additional environmental and phenotypic information with these genomic data.
Postdocs are expected to contribute to the lab's culture of open scientific discovery and to share methodological advances and biological discoveries at both national and international venues.

#### Qualifications

1. Candidates are expected to have an MD, PhD, or equivalent, with a strong background in computer science, machine learning, statistics, genetics, bioinformatics, or closely related field and programming experience with attributable contributions to source code.

2. The ideal candidate will have a track record of scientific productivity and leadership, and will strive for robust and reproducible analytical workflows.

3. The ideal candidate will have experience handling large datasets in a UNIX/LINUX environment, experience with high performance cluster or cloud computing, and a knowledge of existing software packages used for machine learning.

#### Pay and Benefits

Postdoc positions in our lab start at a non-negotiable starting salary, which is currently $70,000 per year.
These positions are considered [Postdoctoral Trainee Appointments at Penn](https://www.med.upenn.edu/postdoc/bpp-policies-table-of-contents-section-3.html), which makes the postdoc eligible for [an insurance plan](https://clients.garnett-powers.com/pd/upenn/) and other benefits, including the [New Child Leave Policy](https://www.med.upenn.edu/postdoc/bpp-policies-table-of-contents-section-3.html).
Additional information about Biomedical Postdoc Positions at Penn is available on [the program website](https://www.med.upenn.edu/postdoc/).

#### Applying

To apply, provide a CV, a one to two page statement of research interests, and the names and contact information for three references through [our application portal](https://greene-lab.breezy.hr/p/bf7972c74ec4).

### Graduate Students

Available graduate opportunities will be posted on the Clemson [Assistantship Openings](https://www.clemson.edu/cafls/plant-environmental-sciences/students/assistantships.html) site. Prospective students should apply through the Clemson Graduate School [Admissions](https://www.clemson.edu/graduate/admissions/apply/new-applicants.html) page. Students are expected to pursue support from intramural or extramural fellowships throughout their graduate tenure.

As a member of our group, graduate students will gain knowledge in phenomics as it applies to plant breeding and genetics. Collaborations across multi-disciplinary research groups will be expected. We provide training through group meetings, individual meetings, and a supportive lab environment.

### Undergraduate Students

We welcome undergraduate students who are committed to research into our lab. We are happy to introduce and train undergraduates in aspects of genetics, phenotyping, and phenomics. If you are an undergraduate interested in discussing research opportunities please [contact Trevor]({{ site.baseurl }}/contact).

### Programmers

Our programming team is responsible for most of the code that goes into our apps, algorithms, and analytical pipelines. They are expected to maintain high standards of documentation, clarity, efficiency, and maintainability in their own code, and also help the other members of the lab achieve the same in their code.

[Contact Trevor]({{ site.baseurl }}/contact) to be notified when job postings are available.

### Postdoctoral Associates

We regularly have research opportunities for postdoctoral level scientists who have experience in plant genetics and computer science. Available opportunities will be posted on [here]({{ site.baseurl }}/news). To be considered, send [Trevor]({{ site.baseurl }}/contact) a cover letter, curriculum vitae, statement of research interests, and contact information for three references.
